# SIGINT-Drone
## Creation of a homemade Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Drone designed to capture unencrypted data

This will be a Glider styled drone which will carry a Raspberry Pi 4 alongside a HackRF to capture unencrypted data in the air.  
The glider will be built using OpenVSP alongside XFOIL and use a symmetrical airfoil, specifically the MH60-il.  

## Planning

Ongoing documentation is currently being created to explain the workings of this project.  
There will be a Python script alongside in order to capture data such as weather signals and such.
